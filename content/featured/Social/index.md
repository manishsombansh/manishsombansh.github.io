Built a timeline page by integrating all previous features to demonstrate a mini social networking site like Facebook. Configured, populated and deployed heterogeneous SQL and NoSQL, databases to build a mini social networking website hosted on GCP. Implemented login feature using MySQL. Stored social graph relationship using graph database Neo4j to fetch list of followers for a particular user. Fetched posts and comments made by a social user on a userâ€™s timeline using MongoDB.
