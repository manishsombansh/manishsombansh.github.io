Configured and provisioned AWS S3, Lambda and SNS with a thumbnail generator function using Java to generate thumbnails for uploaded videos. Used AWS Lambda and Rekognition API to detect labels from the thumbnails and use them to classify an image. Implemented a video searching feature for a YouTube like application using AWS CloudSearch for users to search videos by content. Generated gifs for uploaded videos when user hovers on a particular video search result.
