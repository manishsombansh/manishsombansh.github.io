Designed and implemented a realistic solution to join and process multiple streams of GPS data using Samza API to setup a driver matching service like Uber. Generated streams of data using Kafka Producer and made it available for Samza consumer. Developed an application to process streams of IoT device data and static data using Samza to setup an advertising system of restaurants for the rider once he gets into the cab based on his interests.
