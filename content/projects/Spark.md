Implemented an iterative computation on a Twitter social graph (10GB) to rank each user by their influence using the graph-parallel framework GraphLab to implement the PageRank algorithm using Apache Spark and Scala. Deployed the Spark program on Azure HDInsight and optimized it to meet performance objectives by tuning parameters in Spark configuration and writing effective code in Spark-Scala. Deployed the same application on Azure Databricks to understand performance boosts and platform improvements when compared to Azure HDInsight while running Spark jobs.
