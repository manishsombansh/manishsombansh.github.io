Developed a RESTful webservice to fetch an artistâ€™s albums from iTunes store using the iTunes API and deployed it to Heroku Cloud. Built an android application interacting with the Cloud API to fetch the album details by accepting an artist name as input. Developed an analytical dashboard for application statistics and integrated it with MongoDB over Heroku Cloud.
