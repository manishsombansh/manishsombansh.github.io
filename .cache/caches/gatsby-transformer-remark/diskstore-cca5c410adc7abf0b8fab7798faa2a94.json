Processed 1TB raw data using Apache Spark and Scala to perform ETL and load data into MySQL and HBase database systems. Used Undertow framework and load balancer for front end. Employed backend using MySQL and HBase, improved performance by implementing several optimizations ranging from schema design, database parameter tuning, horizontal scaling, replication and sharding, and monitored performance using AWS CloudWatch to identify performance bottlenecks. Migrated the web service to use managed web services provided by Amazon in the final phase of the project. Used AWS LightSail for the front end and RDS, Aurora for the backend.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":834,"offset":834}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":834,"offset":834}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":835}}}}
