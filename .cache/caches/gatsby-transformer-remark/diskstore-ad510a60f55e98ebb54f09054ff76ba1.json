Deployed the model onto Google cloud machine learning engine and used Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model and increase accuracy. Built a fare prediction web service using Google App Engine to predict fare prices on basis of attributes like pickup<em>datetime, pickup</em>longitude, dropoff_longitude etc by using the model hosted on ML engine. Developed a machine learning application which accepts speech queries and responds with a speech result in the context of fare prediction by using GCP API’s (text to speech, speech to text, NLP, Google Maps). Enhanced the fare prediction API by accepting images of landmarks as the trip pickup and drop off locations using Google Cloud Vision and AutoML API’s.</p>"}
