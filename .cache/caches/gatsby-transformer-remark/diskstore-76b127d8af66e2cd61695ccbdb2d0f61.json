Deployed the Spark program on Azure HDInsight and optimized it to meet performance objectives by tuning parameters in Spark configuration and writing effective code in Spark-Scala. Deployed the same application on Azure Databricks to understand performance boosts and platform improvements when compared to Azure HDInsight while running Spark jobs.</p>"}
